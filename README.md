## NOTES

- In the section "Screens" in the tailwind.config.js file, the order of the screen matters.
- When using classes, the specificity goes bottom top according to the section "Screens" in the tailwind.config.js file (in this case, "phone" should be specified all the time there is a discrepancy between "phone" and "desktop").
